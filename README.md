Project that includes authentication and interaction with an API

## Running steps

-Then, use npm `install` to install the dependencies

-ENJOY!

## Observations

The API's cart quantity update wasn't working at the time of project upload

The purpose of the project was to use Ngrx, at the end I didn't use it but I was learning (thworically)
